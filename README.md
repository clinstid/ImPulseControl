# ImPulseControl

Control notification pulse light on Android devices with a schedule.

## Build

Make sure that you have updated your Android SDK packages and installed the Android Support Repository with the Android SDK Manager because this app uses the support library which is sadly not available in the central Maven repository.

```
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/android/sdk
./gradlew build
```
